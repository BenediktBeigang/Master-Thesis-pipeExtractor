= pipe-vector-extractor

.pipeExtraction.py
Trys to find vectors based on two points of the segemented pointcloud, that have a lot of points in between. 
Creates a `xxx_all_pipes.json` file with the vectors and a `xxx_all_pipes.obj` file with the 3D representation of the pipes.
The `.obj` can be used in CloudCompare to visualize the pipes.

.armatureExtraction.py:
Tries to find clusters of points in the segemented pointcloud, based on their distance to each other.
If activated it also can take into account the distance to the found pipes (pipeExtraction).
Creates a `xxx_cluster.json` file with the clusters and a `xxx_cluster_boxes.obj` file with bounding boxes for visualization in CloudCompare.
